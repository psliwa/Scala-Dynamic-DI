This is a library for type-safe, boilerplate-free dynamic dependency injection for Akka actors. It offers a DI model for actors dependent on asynchronous dependencies, like:
* `Future` calls
* messages received from other actors

The `Dependencies` holds dependencies for an actor represented as `Future` computation. You can build dependencies for an actor using `Future`'s, functions and calls to other actors. `Dependencies` class is aware of types of all dependencies it holds - let's say reflected as a tuple. Each dependency type must be unique. This allows the library to automatically compose dependencies by their type. Each dependency has a set of required types and a type it can produce. This way you can build `Dependencies` with fluent API and while adding a new dependency (look at `requires` function below) Scala compiler will check that:
* all required types for the new dependency are available
* the new produced dependency type will be unique

This means that if you break any of these rules, your code won't compile.

You tell the lubrary how to produce your actor by creating `ProxyProps` instance which requires a function of any arity returning Akka `Props`. The types of arguments of this function must be found in `Dependencies` you are using to conifgure your actor - otherwise the code won't compile.

```scala
val proxyProps = new ProxyProps((products: Products, promotions: Promotions) => Props(new PriceCalculator(products, promotions)))

val dependencies = Dependencies().withVal(user).withFuture(futureShop)
      .requires(basketDependency)
      .requires(promotionsDependency)
      .requires(productsDependency)
      
val actorRef: ActorRef = system.actorOf(proxyProps from dependencies)
```

# Using the dynamic DI

First, you have to create `ProxyProps` for the actor you want to inject dependencies into. You need to pass a function taking `ANYTHING` and returning Akka `Props`. The `ANYHTHING` defines dependencies of your actor. In this case it means that the actor `PriceCalculator` requires two dependencies of types `Products` and `Promotions`:
```scala
import com.github.wilaszekg.scaladdi.akka.ProxyProps

new ProxyProps((products: Products, promotions: Promotions) => Props(new PriceCalculator(products, promotions)))
```

## Constructing dependencies
To start building dependencies for the actor, create a `Dependencies` object:
```scala
import com.github.wilaszekg.scaladdi.Dependencies

val dependencies = Dependencies()
```
It just creates empty dependencies.

### Using known defined values in dependencies
To construct dependencies further you can add a defined and already known value:
```scala
val user: User = ???

val dependencies = Dependencies().withVal(user)
```
or a a simple `Future` value:
```scala
val futureShop: Future[Shop] = ???

val dependencies = Dependencies().withVal(user).withFuture(futureShop)
```
The `Dependencies` constructed here holds dependencies with two types: `User` and `Shop`

### Using dependencies requiring other values
You can use three types od dependencies:
* `FutureDependency` - requires values of a some types and produces a `Future` of another type 
* `ActorDependency` - requires values of a some types and awaits for a response of another type from a given `ActorRef` 
* `FunctionDependency` - requires values of a some types and produces a value of another type 

#### Future Dependency
You create `FutureDependency` passing a function requiring some values and returning a `Future` of a value. This dependency requires `User` and `Shop` to be built and produces a `Basket`:

```scala
import com.github.wilaszekg.scaladdi.FutureDependency

def findBasket(user: User, shop: Shop): Future[Basket] = ???
val basketDependency = FutureDependency(findBasket _)
```
Now, you can add this dependency to an existing `Dependencies` object if it already contains required types: `User` and `Shop`:
```scala
val dependencies = Dependencies().withVal(user).withFuture(futureShop)
  .requires(basketDependency)
```

#### Function Dependency
`FunctionDependency` is very similar to `FutureDependency` but it uses a function producing a synchronous result. It may be a blocking call and it will be wrapped to a `Future`:
```scala
import com.github.wilaszekg.scaladdi.FunctionDependency

def findPromotions(shop: Shop): Promotions = ???
val promotionsDependency = FunctionDependency(findPromotions _)
val dependencies = Dependencies().withVal(user).withFuture(futureShop)
  .requires(basketDependency)
  .requires(promotionsDependency)
```

#### Actor Dependency
`ActorDependency` requires an `ActorRef` a class of expected response message (the type of the dependency) from the actor and a function creating answer message - arguments of this function define typrs required for this dependency:
```scala
import com.github.wilaszekg.scaladdi.akka.ActorDependency

val productsDependency = ActorDependency(basketActorRef, (b: Basket) => AskForProducts(b), classOf[Products])

val dependencies = Dependencies().withVal(user).withFuture(futureShop)
      .requires(basketDependency)
      .requires(promotionsDependency)
      .requires(productsDependency)
```

#### About the dependencies
We have built dependencies from known values `user`, `futureShop` and dyncamic dependencies `basketDependency`, `promotionsDependency` and `productsDependency`. Each dynamic dependency has some requirements and a produced type:
```scala
val basketDependency: FutureDependency[(User, Shop), Basket] = ...
val promotionsDependency: FunctionDependency[Tuple1[Shop], Promotions] = ...
val productsDependency: ActorDependency[Tuple1[Basket], Products] = ...
```
The required types are reflected as tuples. The produced value is always the second type argument.

It is crucial that `Dependencies` keeps lazy computation model of the futures so it will not run any future until you call its `run` method. This method is used by the proxy actor to start fetching the dependencies.

#### Type safety of dependencies
Whenever you add a new dependency using `requires` method, the compile will check the following conditions:
* all required types are present
* the produced type of the new dependency is not present in dependencies yet - it allows the compiler to control the types of all dependencies

### Starting the actor
If you have a `ProxyProps` and `Dependencies` instances, you have to use them to obtain a `Props` instance and start a proxy actor (using Akka context or system):
```scala
val props: Props = proxyProps from dependencies
val proxyActor: ActorRef = context.actorOf(props)
```

The proxy actor hides complexity of running future dependencies and allows you to implement simple actors code.

### Configuring the proxy
When you create `ProxyProps` instance you only need to pass a `propsFunction`. But you can configure it with some additional properties:
* `dependenciesTriesMax` - how many times the proxy will try to run the future dependencies if any of the future fails
* `reConfigureAfterTerminated` - specifies what happens if the target actor is terminated. Is set to `true`, the proxy will run the future dependencies once again to recover the actor
* `supervisionStrategy` - Akka supervision strategy for the target actor - specifies how the proxy will deal with its child proxied actor
* `dependencyError` - a function transforming an error to a message to be sent from the proxy to its parrent if fetching the future dependencies fails
* 
`ProxyProps` provides defaults for all these properties:
```scala
ProxyProps(propsFunction, dependenciesTriesMax: Option[Int] = None,
  reConfigureAfterTerminated: Boolean = true,
  supervisionStrategy: SupervisorStrategy = SupervisorStrategy.defaultStrategy,
  dependencyError: Throwable => Any = ProxyProps.defaultError)
```
